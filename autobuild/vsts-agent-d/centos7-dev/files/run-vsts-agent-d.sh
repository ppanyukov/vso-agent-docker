$(basename $0): Runs VSTS agent in unattended manner.

Usage: the following environmental variables must be set:

    - VSTS_AGENT_NAME_PREFIX
    - VSTS_AUTH_TYPE
    - VSTS_AUTH_TOKEN
    - VSTS_POOL
    - VSTS_URL

Example:

    env \\
        VSTS_AGENT_NAME_PREFIX="some_prefix" \\
        VSTS_AUTH_TYPE="PAT" \\
        VSTS_AUTH_TOKEN="4ji744afn..." \\
        VSTS_POOL="Name of agent pool" \\
        VSTS_URL="https://company.visualstudio.com" \\
        $0


Example: Running in docker container

    docker run \\
        -d \\
        -e VSTS_AGENT_NAME_PREFIX="some_prefix" \\
        -e VSTS_AUTH_TYPE="PAT" \\
        -e VSTS_AUTH_TOKEN="4ji744afn..." \\
        -e VSTS_POOL="Name of agent pool" \\
        -e VSTS_URL="https://company.visualstudio.com" \\
        DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME

Some features:

    - sane and predictable agent naming which works with restarts
    - correct handling of SIGTERM
    - unregisters the agent from VSO when it stops via SIGTERM (best effort)
    - maskig of VSTS_ environment variables
    - suitable for running on clusters (ACS/Mesos/DCOS)

    # Feature: security
    #
    # Make effort to secure the credendials so that they cannot be obtained
    # easily by crafting build tasks run by the agent or via UI in VSO:
    #
    #   - using /proc/PID/environ
    #   - using /bin/env command
    #   - using .Credentials file created by agent registration (plain text)
    #   - using ps -ef (e.g. we can't start agent with secret tokens on command line).
    #
    # The approach is this:
    #
    #   - wrapper script runs as root
    #
    #   - it ensures the VSTS_ vars are not exported to child agent process
    #
    #   - it performs agent startup in two steps:
    #       - registration: this write stuff to .Credentials
    #       - running: agent is started without giving credentials at command line.
    #
    #   - agent is started as non-priviledged user
    #
    #   - after the agent starts, we change mode of .Credentials file
    #     to be owned by root and only root can read it.
    #  
    #   - on shutdown we allow the agent to read .Credentials again to
    #     unregister from VSO.
    #
    #
    # How this solves the problem:
    #
    #   - the build tasks will not be able to read /proc/1/environ where the
    #     VSTS_ vars will be present because this will be owned by root.
    #
    #   - running ps -ef will not reveal VSTS_ vars because we don't start
    #     agent with command line params
    #
    #   - running /bin/env as one of the build tasks is safe because we will
    #     not export VSTS_ vars to child processes
    #
    #   - similarly VSTS_ vars will not be exposed as capabilities in VSO
    #     because we do not make these available as env vars to the agent process
    #
    #   - build tasks will not be able to 'cat .Credentials' because it will be
    #     owned by root and only root will be able to read it.
    #
    # The implementation is spread around in this file with relevant comments
    # where appropriate.

    # Feature: Reliable restart for 'docker run -d --restart=always' 
    # in this scenario:
    #
    #   - Start agent in daemonised mode with --restart=always
    #   - In VSO manually delete the agent from the pool
    #   - The running agent will crash
    #   - Docker will restart the agent but it will not be
    #     able to start.
    #   - Docker will keep restarting forever and never succeed.
    #
    # The fix is to always delete agent registration kept in .Agent.
    # and perform fresh registration every time we run this script.
    # Because we also remove the agent from VSO on clean stop this should
    # not cause pool filling up with dead agents in most cases.
    #
    # Such behaviour also has benefits:
    #
    #   - consistent behaviour with Mesos/ACS/Marathon when
    #     restarting agents there.
    #
    #   - very simple rules: you run the script, you get new
    #     registration
    #
    #
    # TODO(ppanyukov): consider more clever way of doing this, e.g
    # try registration or running, if any of them fail then
    # delete .Agent file and retry?

    # Feature: good predictable agent naming.
    #
    # Agent names must be unique in VSO.
    # We also want them recognisable.
    # We also want agents show up in order of registration in VSO.
    #
    # Solution:
    #   - UUID for agent name
    #   - Use VSTS_AGENT_NAME_PREFIX pre prefix the agent with predefined string,
    #     e.g. myagent.
    #   - Use date-time after agent prefix to make agents show up in order of
    #     registration since UUID is random.
    #   - Observe restriction of 64 chars for agent names.
    #
